# Arcade Assignment

Use the arduino and your computer to create a significant improvement upon the arcade games given to you.

## Suggested avenues for improvement

You are welcome to suggest anything, however here are some ideas to guide your thinking.

1. Hardware improvements - Use physical objects, such as cardboad (or other materials you would like to bring in) to improve the ability for a player to play a game/use a program
2. Hardware improvements - Use circuit elements, such as resistors, different sensors to improve playability
3. MC improvements - Program the arduino to deal with sensors differently:
  i. Poll sensors (detect multipls times)
  ii. Average sensor values
  iii. Remove bad values from sensors
  iv. Amplify good values
4. MC improvements - Program the arduino to play the game differently:
  i. Use the arduino to process up/down controls into x, y controls
  ii. Use the arduino to process multiple sensors into a single value (or fewer values)
5. MC improvements - Have outputs for score/difficulty, things going on in the game
5. Software improvements - Create a computer player using the arduino
6. Software improvements - Manage the player difficulty of the arduino
6. Software improvements - Edit the processing games in any way to improve playability or aesthetics (use documentation on processing.org)

## Initial Proposal

With your group first determine what aspects you are most interested in. What would you feel the most interested in learning? What would you be most interested in presenting in your portfolio? What fields of engineering do you want to look into?

Write a short proposal which includes a few things:

1. The name of who is in your group
2. What general improvement do you want to work on
3. Why this interests you
4. A list of small steps that can work towards a larger improvement. These will be aspects you want to prototype and build upon. They should be manageable but work towards some goal.

## Deliverables

A zip file which contains the following:

1. Arduino program files of each prototype, each should be well-commented, and should have a large initial comment which contains the following information:

    Authors, Date,
    Purpose of the program,
    Circuit wiring,
    How it interfaces with a computer,

    *Any issues, concerns or questions that occurred during creating the program.*

    *What help you received in creating this project and from whom*

2. Processing files (if there were any changes to the processing files), which contain a similar comment.

3. Any image/video files of the project working, or any documentation of errors and issues.

*Remember that the errors and issues are far more important than the sucesses.*

*Documentation should be professional enough to use on college and job applications. (Correct spelling, proper grammar, etc.)*
